Truth be told, the leadership standards in our country have been set low. Becoming a leader in South Africa is not difficult. Any clown can wake up tomorrow and feed the people empty slogans, or entertain them with song and dance, and instantly become their leader. Take our current president, for instance. He may be a billionaire and he may speak polished English, but where is evidence that proves he knows what he is doing? What original idea has he ever produced? Alas, he used empty slogans such as “New Dawn” and “Thuma Mina” to parachute himself into the presidency. What about his predecessor? Why do we still adore him ? Is it because he was a great thinker who expressed ideas worth remembering? The answer is no. We love him because he was a giggler who entertained us with his trademark song and dance moves. Our problem as South Africans is that we are an impressionable bunch. This is why we are not critical when it comes to electing leaders. In other countries like China competitive exams are used to select the best possible candidates to lead. Unlike us, their leadership standards are high. It comes as no surprise therefore that their countries are so advanced. Going into the future, we must do better if we wish to see our country advance.
